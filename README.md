# Sustainable everything

Your guide to everything that is good for the earth and good for you!

Hi y'all  - I'm super happy to see that we're all actively being better about things we already have and finding a new home or use for them. As always, the most sustainable thing you can do is use things you already have. 

I'd also like to emphasize the sustainability angle on buying as well, for items we're bringing into our homes. I've noticed that this takes work and sometimes makes it the 'not-so-convenient' option. Here's what I have so far, pease add to it from your own experiences as well! 

Credit to lots of different YouTube channels I watch and instagram accounts I follow.
